					<h2>About</h2>
					BA (Hons) Arch, B Arch, MSc, Barrister, Architect, Adjudicator and Chartered Arbitrator

					With more than 40 years of professional activity in the construction industry and dispute resolution, Chris has the breadth and depth of knowledge and experience essential to properly adjudicate in contractual disputes under the Housing Grants (Construction &amp; Regeneration) Act or arbitration under the 1996 Act.

					Since being called to the Bar in 1996 he has focused on being a better adjudicator and arbitrator rather than practising at the Bar. He has been involved in over 250 construction related disputes as arbitrator, adjudicator, adviser or, representative.

					His experience is unique in that, unlike many dual qualified professionals, he has a substantial track record of building projects which he has personally designed and supervised. Furthermore, he has prepared detailed technical specifications for substantial projects. Added to his MSc in construction law and having been called to the Bar in 1996 he has a deep insight into technical, professional and contractual disputes.
					 
					Many disputes require ability to deal with the project costs or the legal costs. This is well within Chris’s skill base. He has settled final account, valued variations, decided extensions of time etc as part of his responsibilities as lead consultant and latterly in many disputes.  He is also fully familiar with settling costs under the CPR. 

					<p>Chris also plays the guitar, <span id='song-start'>click here</span> to hear one of his songs. <i>You can pause it by using the button to the left</i></p>

							This ward and day care unit for the elderly was designed as part of the redevelopment of Whelley Hospital, Wigan. The redevelopment project used traditional procurement with Chris as architect and lead consultant. The main building is shown but the project included new site-wide boiler/heating systems, kitchens and admin facilities all to be incorporated with the upgrade of existing ward units. The project was complex due to the need to maintain existing facilities and also due to poor ground conditions.
